## Hiya, I'm Goudham 👋

I care a lot about open-source software.

- 🔭  I study and work at the same time, learn more about that
  [here](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/undergraduate/graduateapprenticeships/).
- 🌱  I'm endlessly curious and love learning about anything.
- 💬  Ask me about anything related to Java/Python/Rust and/or microservice
  architectures.
- 🎨  I like [pretty colours](https://github.com/catppuccin).
